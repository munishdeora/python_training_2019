Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters of one to spell the second.  
For example, the following words are anagrams:

Dictionaries allow you to find a key quickly.

REAL WORLD USAGE OF SETS

# Real Life Example 
employees = ['Sita', 'Rohit', 'Sylvester', 'Ram', 'Kunal', 'Yogendra', 'Laxman', 'Dev' ]

developers = ['Kunal', 'Sita', 'Sylvester', 'Dev', 'Ram']

# Frozensets

# Though sets can't contain mutable objects, sets are mutable: 
# Frozensets are like sets except that they cannot be changed, 
# i.e. they are immutable: 

cities = frozenset(["Frankfurt", "Basel","Freiburg"])
cities.add("Strasbourg")

    
# Example
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
fSet = frozenset(vowels)
print("The frozen set is: ", fSet)



# Another Example
# dictionary key must be immutable.
# frozenset is hashable so you can use it as a key in a dictionary

person = {"name": "John", "age": 23, "sex": "male"}
fSet = frozenset(person)
print("The frozen set is: ", fSet)


# Frozensets are useful in situations where you want to use a set, 
# but you need an immutable object
# For example, you canâ€™t define a set whose elements are also sets, 
# because set elements must be immutable:

x1 = set(['foo'])
x2 = set(['bar'])
x3 = set(['baz'])
x = {x1, x2, x3}


#If you really feel compelled to define a set of sets (hey, it could happen), 
#you can do it if the elements are frozensets, because they are immutable:
x1 = frozenset(['foo'])
x2 = frozenset(['bar'])
x3 = frozenset(['baz'])
x = {x1, x2, x3}

  Problem Statement:
  I recently decided to move a popular community  mailing list (3,000 subscribers, 
  60-80 postings/day) from my server to Google Groups. 
  I asked people to joint he Google-based list themselves, 
  and added many others myself, as the list manager. 
  However, after nearly a week, only half of the list had been moved. 
  I somehow needed to learn which people on the old list hadn't yet 
l  signed up for the new list.


  Fortunately, Google will let you export a list of members of a group to 
  CSV format. 
  Also, Mailman (the list-management program I was using on
  my server) allows you to list all of the e-mail addresses being used 
  for a list. Comparing these lists, I think, offers a nice chance to look
  at several different aspects of Python, and to consider how we can 
  solve this real-world problem in a "Pythonic" way.


  The goal of this project is thus to find all of the e-mail addresses on 
  the old list that aren't on the new list. The old list is in a file 
  containing one e-mail address per line, as in:
