Code Challenge

  Problem Statement:
      import random

    names = ['Mary', 'Isla', 'Sam']
    code_names = ['Mr. Pink', 'Mr. Orange', 'Mr. Blonde']

    for i in range(len(names)):
        names[i] = random.choice(code_names)

    print (names)

As you can see, this algorithm can potentially assign the same secret code name to multiple secret agents. 


Rewrite the above code using map and lambda.

(Hopefully, the secret agents will have good memories and won’t forget each other’s secret code names during the secret mission.)


Rewrite the above code using map.

Try rewriting the code below using map, reduce and filter. 
Filter takes a function and a collection. 
It returns a collection of every item for which the function returned True.

    Population Counting
  Filename: 
    Population.py
  Problem Statement:
      
      The given input has a number of rows, each with four fields from a table, containing:
          

          Rank,City,Population,State or union territory
          1,Mumbai,"124.42",Maharashtra


    You are required to output:

        Country, State, Population of the state (obtained by summing up the population of each city in that state)  


    Sample Input

    1,Mumbai,"124.42",Maharashtra
    9,Pune,"31.24",Maharashtra
    13,Nagpur,"24.05",Maharashtra
    6,Chennai,"46.46",Tamil Nadu
    59,Salem,"8.31",Tamil Nadu


    Sample Output

    {"key":"India,Tamil Nadu","value":54.77}
    {"key":"India,Maharashtra","value":179.72}


    Explanation

    The population of India,Tamil Nadu is obtained by adding the population of 
    Chennai and Salem. 
    This process is repeated for India,Maharashtra. 


    Refer to population.csv
