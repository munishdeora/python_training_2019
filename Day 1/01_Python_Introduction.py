How to store data in Python variables 
  Variable is like a Box and you put a literal in it 
  Literal can be of any above types
  Introduce the concept of Heap and Stack
  Python variables in Stack are references to objects in Heap
  Actual data is contained in the object
  In Python everything is object

  Identity function id() can be used to find the unique identity of the object it is pointing to 


"""

#   Example for explanation with visual
x = 42

id(x)

Naming Convention (Trainer Hands On)
    A name in Python program is called identifier

    Valid characters for variable names, class name, module name, function name ( Identifiers)
        "A" through "Z" 
        "a" through "z" 
        underscore _ 
        digits 0 through 9 (except for the first character) 
  
  Variable names and identifier names can additionally contain Unicode characters as well.
  
  Rules
      1. Alphabet Symbols (Either Upper case OR Lower case)
      2. If Identifier is start with Underscore (_) then it indicates it is private.
      3. Identifier should not start with Digits.
      4. Identifiers are case sensitive.
      5. We cannot use reserved words as identifiers
      6. There is no length limit for Python identifiers. But not recommended to use too lengthy
      identifiers.
      7. Dollor ($) Symbol is not allowed in Python.

Best Practice for Naming Convention

"""
    1.If identifier starts with _ symbol then it indicates that it is private

We can represent int values in the following ways
    1. Decimal form         (a = 10)
    2. Binary form          (a = 0b1111 )
    3. Octal form           (a = 0o123)
    4. Hexa decimal form    (a = 0xFACE )
    Being a programmer we can specify literal values in decimal, binary, octal and hexa
    decimal forms. But PVM will always provide values only in decimal form.

    a=10
    b=0o10
    c=0x10
    d=0b10
    print(a) #10
    print(b) #8
    print(c) #16
    print(d) #2

    Base Conversions
    1.bin(): We can use bin() to convert from any base to binary
    2. oct(): We can use oct() to convert from any base to octal
    3. hex(): We can use hex() to convert from any base to hexa decimal
    
    Complex Data Type:
        A complex number is of the form
        a + bj 
        a is known as Real part 
        b is imaginary part
        j = sqrt of -1
